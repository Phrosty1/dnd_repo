# The Wild Sheep Chase

## Summary
The party's attempt to grab a rare afternoon of downtime is interrupted by a frantic sheep equipped with a Scroll of Speak to Animals and a fierce determination to get their attention. This is no mere beast, however, but a wizard fallen victim to an embittered apprentice wielding a Wand of True Polymorph.

Transformed assassins are looking to grab themselves a mutton dinner, while the only object capable of restoring his opposable thumbs lies in the hands of his former pupil and current nemesis. Fortunately, the woolly wizard has found new allies he can rely on, right? Can the heroes put an end to Ahmed Noke's transmutational tyranny and restore an innocent wizard to his true form? There's only one way to find out...

## Using This Adventure
The main text is divided into several distinct scenes, each covering a location, encounter or major plot point. Other information, enemy stat blocks and notes are highlighted in grey boxes.

While it is possible to run the game on the fly, it is recommended that you read the adventure in its entirety before starting to play.

## Adventure Hooks
Getting the players into this adventure is pretty straightforward. All that is requires is that they be spending a few days in a town or city large enough to host a wizard.

If you want to plant seeds in advance, you may wish to introduce the character of Noke through rumours or idle conversation with shopkeepers and innkeepers, who view him with fear and awe.

## Baaa-d News
The adventure begins as the party idle away an afternoon. They might be enjoying a drink at a tavern, resting at their base or simply walking down the street without a care in the world. No matter where they are, however, it soon becomes clear that something quite odd is happening.

There is a sound of clattering hooves, surprised yelps and a frantic bleating. Before the party can react, a sheep bounds towards them. The beast appears to be a regular sheep in every way - fluffy white coat, black face, curled horns - but it is carrying and elaborate scroll in its mouth.

The sheep tries to get close to the most magically-gifted member of the party and waves the scroll at them, letting them take it should they reach for it.

A wax seal purports that it is a Scroll of Speak With Animals (Modified). If a character says this out loud - to explain to other party members, for example - the sheep appears to nod and bleat enthusiastically.

Should they use the scroll (simply reading it aloud is enough to activate the spell within), all of them hear the sheep's baaing instantly morphs into cultured, elven-accented Common, albeit with a slight hint of a bleat.

After establishing that the player can understand what it's saying, the sheep introduces itself as **Finethir Shinebright**, a wizard in dire need of aid. If the players are willing to listen, he explains that he recognises them as adventurers and that he is in dire need of their aid.

Specifically, he wants them to help take back an extremely powerful magical artefact from a dangerous, possibly insane wizard.

He will attempt to tell his story, but shortly after he starts the sound of howling fills the air...

## Shepherds, Crooks
*A loud howling fills the air, accompanied by the sound of angry yells and the occasional scream that seem to be drawing closer and closer.*

*The cause quickly becomes apparent as a huge Half-Orc swaggers towards you, pushing his way through the crowd without a care for anybody standing in his way. In front of him walk appear to be large wolves wearing iron collars, while a hulking figure in a dirty brown cloak travels in his wake with footfalls loud enough to be heard over the ruckus.*

*The Half-Orc sets his small eyes on you and strides forward with one hand resting on the hilt of a greatsword.*

*"That sheep is Master Noke's... he desires to have it back."*

---

The Half-Orc, **Guz**, is accompanied by trio of collared **Wolves** (MM p341) with strangely intelligent eyes, while the huge figure behind him is actually a polymorphed **Brown Bear** (MM p319).

He demands that he be given "Master Noke's sheep," which he claimed has escaped, and is of great sentimental value to his master. Any mention of Shinebright's true nature is met with hollow, mirthless laughter.

Guz is not a bright fellow, but he is very loyal and determined to complete his task. His trackers know that Shinebright is there, no matter how well the party tries to hide him, and will not take no for an answer.

While he prefers violence and intimidation, he is also willing to offer bribes and promises of magical favours if that looks like the best option.

If he feels like he's not making progress, Guz will simply attack without warning. The wolves will follow him up, while the cloaked figure will let its hood fall and run into combat with a terrible roar.

The exact details of any battle that breaks out will depend on the location. If it takes place in an inn, tables and overturned chairs litter the floor. In a street, you may wish to have frightened passers-by form zones of difficult terrain.

All of the beasts still have an intelligent human mind contained within them, and act intelligently. Guz is happy to charge into the front line and take on any heavy hitters alongside the Brown Bear.

Meanwhile the Wolves will aim to cut round behind the party in a bid to grab Shinebright - he uses the statistics of a **Pony** (MM p325) but with INT and WIS scores of 18 and 14 respectively.

They intend to capture Shinebright, not kill him. If Guz captures him, he and his allies will set off for Noke's home. The party will have to decide if they follow, potentially launching a chase scene.

## Roleplaying Shinebright
Arrogant, self-obsessed and filled with an inflated sense of his own ego, Finethir Shinebright is one of the people worst suited to be transformed into a sheep. Still, no matter his form the former elven wizard manages to exude an air of fussy, bookish intellectualism

Despite his flaws, however, he is generally good-hearted. Assuming he notices them and it doesn’t inconvenience him too much he will try to help others where possible, though he will loudly complain of their inability to grasp concepts as simple as poly-planal transweave theory.

Once upon a time the local nobles, merchants and arcanists spoke the name of Finethir Shinebright with respect, awe and grudging admiration. A master of transmutation, he would regularly be called upon to carry out grand tasks such as clearing blocked roads by turning massive boulders into rabbits.

Two years as a sheep have taught him very little about humility, but a lot about grass. If he returns to his natural form, Shinebright is a willow-thin high elf with straw-coloured hair and an extremely long nose.

## After the Dust Settles
Once Noke's goons have been defeated, distracted or otherwise dealt with, Shinebright pleads with the party. Without their help, he is doomed. Noke still has many guards still working for him and eventually they will find him.

If they’re feeling mercenary, he reminds the party that in his true form he is a powerful and wealthy wizard and promises great rewards. He is more than willing to commit to deals that he knows he can't actually fulfil.

In any case, Shinebright will explain:

• Until two years ago he owned and worked out of a tower on the outskirts of town. He was a wizard of no small talent, specialising in transmutation magic. His most prized possession - and probably the key to his success - was an incredibly rare Wand of True Polymorph.

• One fateful night he ended from his meditative trance to find his apprentice, Ahmed Noke, standing over him, clutching the wand. Shinebright demanded to know what the boy was doing, but the only noise he could produce was an angry ‘baaaaah’.

• The wizard became a virtual prisoner in his own garden. He was forced to graze on nothing but grass and buttercups while hungry wolves and other beasts - actually polymorphed guards - looked on.

• Last night he felt hope for the first time in many months when Noke left his home without closing the door. Shinebright snuck in, made his way to an old bookshelf and stole the Scroll of Speak to Animals. He then rushed into town with the scroll clenched between his teeth, and was searching desperately for the aura of magic that would indicate someone able to activate the spell when he found the party.

• In order to turn back into his original form he needs another dose of True Polymorph. Which means he needs access to his old wand.

• His former apprentice still dwells in Shinebright's old home, located just to the south-east of town. He keeps the wand on him at all times and only leaves if he absolutely has to.

• He knows his old home's layout intimately, and is more than happy to describe it in endless detail.

## Roleplaying Guz

A hulking brute of a half-orc, Guz views violence and intimidation as the only sensible methods for achieving his goals. He also assumes that most people feel the same way, and prefers to get his own violence in first.

Though to most outside observers he may appear evil, he is incredibly loyal to Noke - who genuinely doesn't care what a creature looks like on the outside - and owes him unswerving devotion.

Guz isn't particularly intelligent and can be easily confused by quick-talking foes, though this usually just makes him angrier.

However, he is also fond of trying to use long, complicated words he has picked up from Noke - though the extent to which he actually understands what they mean is probably up for debate.

## The House in the Woods
The path to Noke's Tower cuts off from a main road a few miles out of town, darting off between a gap in the bushes. It is a well-trodden route that soon begins to weave its way between tall oak trees.

Anyone who cares to examine the path for tracks will easily see the impression of many feet and paws, with the most fresh sets appearing to match up with the group led by Guz.

The track continues through sparse woodland for perhaps a mile without any sign of habitation. Unless they know what to look for, the party may be somewhat surprised by the view that awaits them when Shinebright's old house appears through the treetops.

## Roleplaying Noke
Noke once hero-worshipped Shinebright and served as his apprentice for many years. However, as time dragged on and on there was never any change in their relationship.

Decades passed and still the master transmuter treated him like a child, expected to cook, clean and recite answers by rote. When Noke pressed him on it, Shinebright would explain that his was how he had been taught, and didn't seem to register Noke's claims that, as a human, he couldn't spare a century to serve out an apprenticeship.

At the same time, Noke began to realise that much of Shinebright's acclaim came not from his own abilities - extensive as they were - but from the Wand of True Polymorph he wielded.

Eventually he cracked, and turned on his former master before setting himself up as a master wizard. However, a combination of guilt and suddenly unstoppered ambition spelled bad news for his mental state.

He is paranoid that someone will attack him as he attacked Shinebright and rarely sleeps. This paranoia has led him to invest in a troop of guards, many of whom he has transmuted into stronger, more bestial forms.

---
## Noke's Tower
*Rather than stone or glass, the house before you seems to have been formed from the living branches of four sturdy oak trees. These have been shaped and woven to create three thick platforms.*

*The lowest of these platforms is roughly 40ft across and sits about 10ft from the ground. The only obvious route up is a gentle slope formed of roots and branches that connects roughly with the main path.*

*Branches curl around its base, creating a rough bowl shape around it. From where you stand it's possible to see flowers and small trees growing around its edge.*

*By far the largest of the three platforms is the middle one, which looks to be around 60ft. across. It is about 20ft above the ground and is fully enclosed with a wall formed from twisting branches. You can see evenly spaced, window-sized gaps, as well as what appears to be a door at the point closest to the garden platform.*

*The final, tallest platform is roughly 30ft above the ground, and is much smaller than the others. It looks to be linked to the central platform by another small slope.*

*Scattered beneath the platforms are two small wooden huts and a large outhouse.*

---
When the party arrives at the compound, there is a trio of **Apes** (MM p317) either sleeping or playing with an oversized pair of dice on the lawn, with iron greatswords stuck into the ground next to them. A **Brown Bear** is in the outhouse, taking care of business.

The door to the central platform is almost always locked, requiring a DC14 Strength (Athletics) to break down or a DC12 Thieves' Tools check to pick. Inside, the area is divided up in to three sections. One contains a combination library and lab, one a sitting room and one dining room/kitchen. Untidy bookshelves line much of the outer walls and worktables are covered with stacks of ink-spattered notes and complicated anatomical diagrams of various beasts

The tallest platform functions as a bedroom for Noke, containing little beyond a wardrobe, a large wooden bed and a cluttered dressing table.

The huts contain one or two beds each, a few of which are oversized, as well as the general detritus of the common men who occupy them.

Noke is in the central platform, working furiously on new spells. If he notices the party as they approach he will order them to "return the sheep - in return I will not destroy you all." If they talk, he will reveal his reasons for hating Shinebright and boast disjointedly of his own achievements. He will also ask if they killed 'my man, Guz,' and be visibly upset if they have. Should they refuse to return Shinebright he will order his men to attack.

The most important part of any fight that breaks out is Noke, who is offensively weak but can buff his allies dramatically. Once the Brown Bear emerges from the outhouse he will cast Enlarge/Reduce (PHB p237) on it to increase its damage. He will supplement his minions' attacks with Ray of Frost (PHB p271) but will focus on keeping up concentration.

The Apes will act intelligently, and as they are wielding greatswords their Fist attack is replaced by a Slash that deals 10 (2d6+3) slashing damage. They aren't likely to fight to the death and will flee once they fall below half health.

Once it is clear that the fight is lost, or a player simply gets too close to him, Noke will cast Expeditious Retreat (PHB p238) and flee into the central platform, locking the door behind him. He will move to his bedroom as fast as he can and casts True Polymorph on the largest thing he can find - his bed.

Three rounds after he runs away he bursts from the roof of his bedroom riding the Bed Dragon Wyrmling, a beast that looks like a dragon carved from wood, with billowing bedsheets for wings and a tail that ends in a soft pillow. If the party are in the main living area he will crash through the ceiling and attack.

The Wyrmling is not that smart and will use its Splinter Breath as often as possible, simply trying to attack the closest target when it is not available. It will, however, prioritise enemies that use fire against it. While riding the Wyrmling, Noke will simply use Ray of Frost to slow down any party members trying to retreat.

Should the Wyrmling be lost - either to damage or because Noke loses concentration - it will turn back into a thoroughly beaten-up old bed.

Desperate and unwilling to let his old master win, a babbling Noke will then attempt to use the wand on himself, intending to transmute his form into that of some monstrous creature.

However, the over-used wand will crackle, fizz and malfunction with a loud bang, turning Noke into a Gibbering Mouther (MM p157) - a misshapen pile of flesh that bellows incoherently from dozens of mouths. The sad creature will attack mindlessly until completely destroyed.

## Ewe Are Very Clever...
Noke is naturally paranoid and Shinebright's recent escape hasn't exactly improved his outlook. This makes luring him away from the safety of his tower an extremely difficult task, though not an impossible one. Noke's lust for fame and power slightly outweighs his fear of being unseated, for the time being at least. This means that a very, very skilled set of liars with a sufficiently devious plan and a good helping of luck may be able to tempt him with the offer of a particularly prestigious, lucrative contract.

Even so, when Noke leaves he will take all of his remaining bodyguards with him and will be extremely quick to suspect the party of betrayal if there is any hint of a double-cross.

He will, of course, have his wand to hand at all times. Should he be given enough time to cast it, Noke will use a charge of True Polymorph to transmute some nearby item into a Wyrmling that uses roughly the same stats as the Bed Dragon Wyrmling. Depending on what it was made from, it may not have the same flavour and might need to have its resistances/vulnerabilities tweaked slightly.

## Big Choices
Should the players recover the wand it becomes immediately obvious that it is damaged. Anyone proficient in Arcana can tell that it has been modified so it can be used more often, but overuse has rendered it extremely unreliable.

If they wish to speak to Shinebright, a quick search of the central platform will allow them to find another Scroll of Speak with Animals. At the sight of his former apprentice's ruined corpse, Shinebright may even undergo some realisation of how poorly he treated his former apprentice and turn somber despite his triumph.

Even if he is made aware of the dangers associated with his old wand, Shinebright will still be willing to risk his life in order to be turned back into an Elf. However, he is also open to persuasion if the party try to talk him out of it. A compelling argument and a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) will be enough to make the former Wizard reconsider his options.

Before undergoing the risk of having the spell performed on him, Shinebright will ask that if he does die, the party send word to his old college.

## Consequences
**If the party decides to go ahead with the spell and it succeeds,** Shinebright congratulates the party heartily. He will have to be reminded of anything he actually promised them while he was still a sheep, and cannot actually pay any financial reward, as Noke was virtually bankrupt and had sold most items to pay for research materials and guards.

He will, however, be willing to perform transmutations of up to 5th level for them, charging just enough to cover the components. He will also take in any polymorphed guards who fled, promising to work towards returning them to their natural shapes.

**If the party decides to go ahead with the spell and it fails,** Shinebright dies permanently. The party is free to honour his final wish and leave the tower more-or-less intact, or loot to their hearts’ content. The tower is surprisingly empty of anything of benefit to non-transmuters, however, with valuables restricted to expensive lab equipment and arcane paraphernalia estimated to be worth around 1,000gp. If the players wish they can also take the entire tower complex as their own, though this may cause trouble when the local nobles try to pay Noke a visit and find him missing…

**If the party refuse to perform the spell,** Shinebright accepts but will not give up his hopes entirely. He will take back his old home and work towards a way to remove his curse. In any case, he heads to the bedroom and slips on one of his old robes, which he wears until he is transformed back to his natural shape. Though he will be upset with them, Shinebright will acknowledge that he owes the party a large debt.

In any case, any adventurers that help Shinebright to deal with Noke each recieve **500xp**.

## Not Like This...
A stealthy party may be able to steal the wand while Noke sleeps or a combination of lucky rolls and inventive tactics may allow a player to disarm the wizard.

Should this happen, don’t force the story back towards the ‘ideal path’, but allow it to develop naturally.

One thing that you must do, however, is try to provide at least a hint of the dangers associated with the modified wand before the players try and use it. Possibly it sparks unnaturally when a character touches it, or Noke himself may feel honour-bound to warn them.

## Modified Wand of True Polymorph
Formed of a long, thin twig taken from an oak tree, this wand holds 1d4-1 charges of True Polymorph, with a minimum of1. These can be cast by anybody with a spellcasting ability who has spent at least one hour attuning to the wand. The amount of charges resets at dawn each day.

In order to increase the amount of times the spell has been cast, the wand appears to have been fitted with a bulbous, rune-inscribed iron band and has cracks running along its length.

If inspected with a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check, reveal that the modifications have left the wand extremely unreliable. Each time a charge is used the user must pass a DC 17 Intelligence (Arcana) check.

If they succeed, the spell casts normally and the DC needed to use it permanently increases by 1.

If they fail by five or less, the spell will transmute the target into a Gibbering Mouther (MM p157) - a hideous lump of seemingly random limbs, organs and facial features. The creature will attack the nearest target mindlessly, babbling in dozens of broken voices.

This transformation cannot be undone by any spell lower than 9th level and cannot be cancelled by ending concentration. The target can make a saving throw against this effect in the same way they would against a regular casting of True Polymorph.

If they fail by more than five, in addition to the above consequences the wand explodes violently, dealing 1d12 force damage to all creatures within 10 ft for each charge remaining in the wand. This destroys the wand.

# The Unseen Thief
## Summary
The party's peaceful evening is interrupted by a desperate plea for help from a mysterious figure. A valuable magical artifact has been stolen, and the thief is still at large. The only clue is a cryptic message left behind, hinting at a hidden lair deep within the city's sewers. The heroes must navigate the treacherous underground tunnels, confront the thief, and recover the stolen item before it's too late. But beware, for the thief is no ordinary criminal, and the sewers hide dark secrets that could spell doom for the unwary adventurer.

## Using This Adventure
This adventure is designed for a party of 4-6 characters of levels 3-5. It can be run as a standalone adventure or incorporated into an existing campaign. The main text is divided into distinct scenes, each covering a location, encounter, or major plot point. Other information, enemy stat blocks, and notes are highlighted in grey boxes.

While it is possible to run the game on the fly, it is recommended that you read the adventure in its entirety before starting to play.

## Adventure Hooks
Getting the players into this adventure is straightforward. They can be approached by the mysterious figure in a tavern, market, or on the streets of the city. Alternatively, they could stumble upon the cryptic message themselves and decide to investigate.

If you want to plant seeds in advance, you may wish to introduce rumors or idle conversation about a series of recent magical artifact thefts, with the culprit always managing to evade capture.

## A Mysterious Encounter
The adventure begins as the party is going about their evening. They might be enjoying a drink at a tavern, resting at their base, or simply walking down the street without a care in the world. Suddenly, a cloaked figure approaches them, keeping their face hidden. The figure speaks in a hushed, urgent tone:

"Please, I need your help. I am a member of the city's Arcane Council, and a valuable magical artifact has been stolen from our vaults. The thief left behind a cryptic message, hinting at a hidden lair deep within the city's sewers. I cannot go to the city guard, as they are corrupt and in league with the thief. You are my only hope. Will you help me?"

If the party agrees, the council member hands them a scrap of parchment with the following message written in an elegant, flowing script:

"Seek the heart of the city's underbelly, where the waters run deep and the shadows grow long. There, in the lair of the unseen thief, you shall find what was taken. But beware, for the path is treacherous, and the thief is no ordinary criminal."

The council member then vanishes into the night, leaving the party to decipher the message and decide their next move.

## The Sewer Entrance
Following the cryptic message, the party makes their way to the city's sewer system. The entrance is a heavy iron grate set into the ground in a dimly lit alleyway. The grate is locked, but a DC 15 Dexterity check with thieves' tools will open it.

As the party descends into the sewers, they find themselves in a large, circular chamber with several tunnels branching off in different directions. The air is damp and fetid, and the sound of dripping water echoes through the tunnels. A quick search of the chamber reveals a crudely drawn map scratched into the stone wall, with an 'X' marking one of the tunnels.

## The Sewer Tunnels
The tunnels are a labyrinthine network of interconnected passages, some dry and others filled with waist-deep water. The walls are slick with algae and mold, and the air grows colder and damper the deeper the party ventures.

As the party navigates the tunnels, they encounter various hazards and creatures:

1. **Sewer Rats (MM p348)**: Swarms of sewer rats infest the tunnels, scavenging for food. They attack any creatures they perceive as a threat.

2. **Giant Centipedes (MM p334)**: These massive insects lurk in the shadows, waiting to ambush unsuspecting prey.

3. **Giant Leeches (MM p335)**: These grotesque creatures attach themselves to the party members, draining their blood and dealing damage over time.

4. **Sewer Gas**: In some areas, the sewer gas is highly flammable. Any open flame or magical fire spell could cause an explosion, dealing 3d6 fire damage to all creatures in a 15-foot radius (DC 15 Dexterity saving throw for half damage).

5. **Collapsing Tunnels**: Some of the tunnels are unstable and prone to collapse. A DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check will allow the party to spot weak points in the ceiling before a collapse occurs.

## The Hidden Lair
Following the map, the party eventually arrives at a heavy wooden door set into the sewer wall. The door is locked, but a DC 15 Dexterity check with thieves' tools will open it. Beyond the door lies the hidden lair of the unseen thief.

The lair is a large, circular chamber with a high ceiling. The walls are lined with shelves filled with stolen magical artifacts and strange, arcane devices. In the center of the chamber stands a raised dais, upon which rests a pedestal holding the stolen artifact - a glowing, crystalline orb.

The thief, a mysterious figure clad in dark robes and a featureless mask, stands before the pedestal. They are flanked by two **Shadow Demons** (MM p277), summoned to protect the lair.

The thief speaks in a cold, emotionless voice: "You have found me, but you are too late. The artifact is mine, and I will not relinquish it willingly. Prepare to face the consequences of your meddling."

## The Thief's Identity
As the battle begins, the thief's true identity is revealed. They are **Vex'aria**, a former member of the Arcane Council who was expelled for her unorthodox and dangerous experiments. Vex'aria has been stealing magical artifacts to power her latest creation - a device that will allow her to tap into the raw, primal magic of the planes and gain god-like powers.

Vex'aria is a formidable opponent, wielding powerful spells and arcane magic. She is also a master of illusions and can create convincing duplicates of herself to confuse and misdirect her enemies.

If the party manages to defeat Vex'aria and her shadow demons, they can claim the stolen artifact and return it to the Arcane Council. The council member who first approached the party will reward them handsomely for their efforts.

However, if Vex'aria is allowed to complete her device, she will become a powerful and dangerous new force in the world, threatening the balance of magic and potentially plunging the realm into chaos.

## Roleplaying Vex'aria
Vex'aria is a brilliant but unhinged arcane scholar, driven by an insatiable hunger for knowledge and power. She believes that the ends justify the means and has no qualms about stealing, manipulating, or even killing those who stand in her way.

Despite her ruthless nature, Vex'aria is not entirely evil. She genuinely believes that her actions will ultimately benefit the world, even if the path to that goal is paved with suffering and destruction. She is also fiercely intelligent and can hold her own in a battle of wits, using her knowledge of arcane lore to outmaneuver and outsmart her foes.

Vex'aria is a tall, slender woman with pale skin, dark hair, and piercing green eyes. She wears a long, flowing robe adorned with intricate arcane sigils, and her face is obscured by a featureless, expressionless mask.

## The Stolen Artifact
The stolen artifact is a **Sphere of Annihilation** (DMG p201), a deadly and dangerous magical item. It is a small, perfectly spherical object, no larger than a marble, that appears to be made of polished black stone. When activated, it creates a sphere of antimagic that grows to encompass a 60-foot radius, negating magic within that area and dealing 10d6 force damage to any creature caught inside.

The sphere is incredibly rare and valuable, and its theft has caused great concern among the members of the Arcane Council. They are desperate to have it returned, and will reward the party handsomely for its safe recovery.

## Consequences
If the party successfully recovers the sphere and returns it to the Arcane Council, they will be hailed as heroes and rewarded with a significant amount of gold, magical items, and the council's eternal gratitude. They may also be offered positions as official agents of the council, tasked with protecting the city from future threats.

If Vex'aria is allowed to complete her device and gain her newfound powers, she will become a major threat to the city and the surrounding region. The party may be called upon to stop her once again, this time with even higher stakes and greater dangers.

## Alternate Endings
If the party decides to side with Vex'aria and help her complete her device, they will gain a powerful ally but also become embroiled in a web of intrigue and danger. Vex'aria may reward them with magical items or knowledge, but she will also expect them to carry out her bidding and further her goals.

If the party fails to defeat Vex'aria and her shadow demons, they may be captured and imprisoned in the lair. They will have to find a way to escape and regroup before attempting to confront Vex'aria again.

## The Unseen Thief
A stealthy party may be able to sneak into the lair and steal the sphere without confronting Vex'aria directly. However, this will require a series of successful Dexterity (Stealth) checks and may alert Vex'aria to the party's presence, leading to a chase through the sewer tunnels.

If the party manages to steal the sphere and escape, Vex'aria will be furious and will stop at nothing to reclaim her prize. She may send her shadow demons or other minions to hunt down the party and retrieve the sphere by force.

## The Sewer Tunnels
The sewer tunnels are a maze-like network of interconnected passages, filled with hazards and dangers. The party may encounter various creatures and obstacles as they navigate the tunnels, including:

1. **Sewer Rats (MM p348)**: Swarms of sewer rats infest the tunnels, scavenging for food. They attack any creatures they perceive as a threat.

2. **Giant Centipedes (MM p334)**: These massive insects lurk in the shadows, waiting to ambush unsuspecting prey.

3. **Giant Leeches (MM p335)**: These grotesque creatures attach themselves to the party members, draining their blood and dealing damage over time.

4. **Sewer Gas**: In some areas, the sewer gas is highly flammable. Any open flame or magical fire spell could cause an explosion, dealing 3d6 fire damage to all creatures in a 15-foot radius (DC 15 Dexterity saving throw for half damage).

5. **Collapsing Tunnels**: Some of the tunnels are unstable and prone to collapse. A DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check will allow the party to spot weak points in the ceiling before a collapse occurs.

## The Hidden Lair
The hidden lair is a large, circular chamber with a high ceiling. The walls are lined with shelves filled with stolen magical artifacts and strange, arcane devices. In the center of the chamber stands a raised dais, upon which rests a pedestal holding the stolen artifact - a glowing, crystalline orb.

The thief, a mysterious figure clad in dark robes and a featureless mask, stands before the pedestal. They are flanked by two **Shadow Demons** (MM p277), summoned to protect the lair.

The thief speaks in a cold, emotionless voice: "You have found me, but you are too late. The artifact is mine, and I will not relinquish it willingly. Prepare to face the consequences of your meddling."

## The Thief's Identity
As the battle begins, the thief's true identity is revealed. They are **Vex'aria**, a former member of the Arcane Council who was expelled for her unorthodox and dangerous experiments. Vex'aria has been stealing magical artifacts to power her latest creation - a device that will allow her to tap into the raw, primal magic of the planes and gain god-like powers.

Vex'aria is a formidable opponent, wielding powerful spells and arcane magic. She is also a master of illusions and can create convincing duplicates of herself to confuse and misdirect her enemies.

If the party manages to defeat Vex'aria and her shadow demons, they can claim the stolen artifact and return it to the Arcane Council. The council member who first approached the party will reward them handsomely for their efforts.

However, if Vex'aria is allowed to complete her device, she will become a powerful and dangerous new force in the world, threatening the balance of magic and potentially plunging the realm into chaos.

## Roleplaying Vex'aria
Vex'aria is a brilliant but unhinged arcane scholar, driven by an insatiable hunger for knowledge and power. She believes that the ends justify the means and has no qualms about stealing, manipulating, or even killing those who stand in her way.

Despite her ruthless nature, Vex'aria is not entirely evil. She genuinely believes that her actions will ultimately benefit the world, even if the path to that goal is paved with suffering and destruction. She is also fiercely intelligent and can hold her own in a battle of wits, using her knowledge of arcane lore to outmaneuver and outsmart her foes.

Vex'aria is a tall, slender woman with pale skin, dark hair, and piercing green eyes. She wears a long, flowing robe adorned with intricate arcane sigils, and her face is obscured by a featureless, expressionless mask.

## The Stolen Artifact
The stolen artifact is a **Sphere of Annihilation** (DMG p201), a deadly and dangerous magical item. It is a small, perfectly spherical object, no larger than a marble, that appears to be made of polished black stone. When activated, it creates a sphere of antimagic that grows to encompass a 60-foot radius, negating magic within that area and dealing 10d6 force damage to any creature caught inside.

The sphere is incredibly rare and valuable, and its theft has caused great concern among the members of the Arcane Council. They are desperate to have it returned, and will reward the party handsomely for its safe recovery.

## Consequences
If the party successfully recovers the sphere and returns it to the Arcane Council, they will be hailed as heroes and rewarded with a significant amount of gold, magical items, and the council's eternal gratitude. They may also be offered positions as official agents of the council, tasked with protecting the city from future threats.

If Vex'aria is allowed to complete her device and gain her newfound powers, she will become a major threat to the city and the surrounding region. The party may be called upon to stop her once again, this time with even higher stakes and greater dangers.

## Alternate Endings
If the party decides to side with Vex'aria and help her complete her device, they will gain a powerful ally but also become embroiled in a web of intrigue and danger. Vex'aria may reward them with magical items or knowledge, but she will also expect them to carry out her bidding and further her goals.

If the party fails to defeat Vex'aria and her shadow demons, they may be captured and imprisoned in the lair. They will have to find a way to escape and regroup before attempting to confront Vex'aria again.
