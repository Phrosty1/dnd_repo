I made this just so I could share generated campaign stuff.
Two approaches I've taken so far have been to either use this prompt (still working on it, which is why I'm leaving keeping the prompt into the generated results)
```
Characters
Elmyra: Wizard with all four powerful bloodlines. Has dark brown hair, wears a green dress, always seems perfectly put together.
Klaus: Human Paladin, handsome, helpful, keeps his hair buzzcut length.
Kyra: Young child of Elmyra and Klaus who adds cuteness to most scenarios.
Gudmund: Half elf Rogue archer with his own room.
Soras: Dragonborn Barbarian with her own room.

Background: At one time, Elmyra, Klaus, Gudmund, and Soras were adventurers in the land of Saal Alora but since Klaus and Elmyra married and had a child, they live in the cliffside mansion with their daughter Kyra. The cliffside mansion is warded and protected, a perfect base of operations. Elmyra and Klaus, being parents to young Kyra, no longer actively adventure themselves. Gudmund and Soras live in the mansion as well and often leave on adventures together. Elmyra doesn't need to do chores because of the Unseen Servants spell so you don't need to mention chores at all. Being a wizard who is related to many across the large island, Elmyra keeps in regular communication with those who may need the help of adventurers.

Saal Alora is a large island with five large cities named after the family that discovered the island, Darfyn and his four sons, in honor of them colonizing the island a thousand years ago. The city of Darfyn on the western bank, Cradoven to the north, Renarian in the middle, Grenwyn to the southwest, Zinfaren on the southeast coast. Despite the cities being named after the family, Darfyn and the sons are only memories within the cities.

Our current story begins in the cliffside mansion in the early morning.

Write a campaign story. Only Soras and Gudmund will be participating as players. Adventurers may not find any of the features, clues, or items. Structure in markdown the following information:
Title
Tropes Employed (list two common tropes that the story uses)
Story Rough Draft (Write 200 words to lay out the entire arc)
Roleplaying (three new characters) -100 words of backstory -motivations -mannerisms -practical tip for the DM to roleplay as them (This could include suggestions for vocal inflections, gestures, or other non-verbal cues, as well as guidance on how to describe the character's environment, actions, and reactions to create an immersive experience for the players. Please avoid suggesting impractical physical props)
Introduction hook (How the players are brought into the story and how the dungeon master can grab their attention)
Locations (four new locations) -100 word description -Specify schematic details with measurements in feet
Who is met where? -Examine the framework of the story and compile which characters will be in each of the areas to support the story
Stages -clever title -location -events upon arriving -events involving characters (consider who is met where) -events that lead to the next area
Features, Clues, and Items (List up to 5, create interesting extra elements that can be found. they might provide benefits, treasure, add flavor, or offer insight because they are not needed and may not be discovered) -description -location (place these elements within the established locations) -benefit -skill check to obtain them -second chance skill check to obtain them (the players might not get these things!)
Consequences (Assume that the heroes will save the day and outline three endings like "If the party decides to...")
Revised Story (Ignore the rough draft and rewrite the entire story arc in 300 words)
Enemies (Provide stat blocks for the new characters and relevant mobs)
```

OR putting the markdown version of "The Wild Sheep Chase" with instructions to make another campaign with the same style.
