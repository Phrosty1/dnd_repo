# The Unseen Thief
## Summary
The party's peaceful evening is interrupted by a desperate plea for help from a mysterious figure. A valuable magical artifact has been stolen, and the thief is still at large. The only clue is a cryptic message left behind, hinting at a hidden lair deep within the city's sewers. The heroes must navigate the treacherous underground tunnels, confront the thief, and recover the stolen item before it's too late. But beware, for the thief is no ordinary criminal, and the sewers hide dark secrets that could spell doom for the unwary adventurer.

## Using This Adventure
This adventure is designed for a party of 4-6 characters of levels 3-5. It can be run as a standalone adventure or incorporated into an existing campaign. The main text is divided into distinct scenes, each covering a location, encounter, or major plot point. Other information, enemy stat blocks, and notes are highlighted in grey boxes.

While it is possible to run the game on the fly, it is recommended that you read the adventure in its entirety before starting to play.

## Adventure Hooks
Getting the players into this adventure is straightforward. They can be approached by the mysterious figure in a tavern, market, or on the streets of the city. Alternatively, they could stumble upon the cryptic message themselves and decide to investigate.

If you want to plant seeds in advance, you may wish to introduce rumors or idle conversation about a series of recent magical artifact thefts, with the culprit always managing to evade capture.

## A Mysterious Encounter
The adventure begins as the party is going about their evening. They might be enjoying a drink at a tavern, resting at their base, or simply walking down the street without a care in the world. Suddenly, a cloaked figure approaches them, keeping their face hidden. The figure speaks in a hushed, urgent tone:

"Please, I need your help. I am a member of the city's Arcane Council, and a valuable magical artifact has been stolen from our vaults. The thief left behind a cryptic message, hinting at a hidden lair deep within the city's sewers. I cannot go to the city guard, as they are corrupt and in league with the thief. You are my only hope. Will you help me?"

If the party agrees, the council member hands them a scrap of parchment with the following message written in an elegant, flowing script:

"Seek the heart of the city's underbelly, where the waters run deep and the shadows grow long. There, in the lair of the unseen thief, you shall find what was taken. But beware, for the path is treacherous, and the thief is no ordinary criminal."

The council member then vanishes into the night, leaving the party to decipher the message and decide their next move.

## The Sewer Entrance
Following the cryptic message, the party makes their way to the city's sewer system. The entrance is a heavy iron grate set into the ground in a dimly lit alleyway. The grate is locked, but a DC 15 Dexterity check with thieves' tools will open it.

As the party descends into the sewers, they find themselves in a large, circular chamber with several tunnels branching off in different directions. The air is damp and fetid, and the sound of dripping water echoes through the tunnels. A quick search of the chamber reveals a crudely drawn map scratched into the stone wall, with an 'X' marking one of the tunnels.

## The Sewer Tunnels
The tunnels are a labyrinthine network of interconnected passages, some dry and others filled with waist-deep water. The walls are slick with algae and mold, and the air grows colder and damper the deeper the party ventures.

As the party navigates the tunnels, they encounter various hazards and creatures:

1. **Sewer Rats (MM p348)**: Swarms of sewer rats infest the tunnels, scavenging for food. They attack any creatures they perceive as a threat.

2. **Giant Centipedes (MM p334)**: These massive insects lurk in the shadows, waiting to ambush unsuspecting prey.

3. **Giant Leeches (MM p335)**: These grotesque creatures attach themselves to the party members, draining their blood and dealing damage over time.

4. **Sewer Gas**: In some areas, the sewer gas is highly flammable. Any open flame or magical fire spell could cause an explosion, dealing 3d6 fire damage to all creatures in a 15-foot radius (DC 15 Dexterity saving throw for half damage).

5. **Collapsing Tunnels**: Some of the tunnels are unstable and prone to collapse. A DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check will allow the party to spot weak points in the ceiling before a collapse occurs.

## The Hidden Lair
Following the map, the party eventually arrives at a heavy wooden door set into the sewer wall. The door is locked, but a DC 15 Dexterity check with thieves' tools will open it. Beyond the door lies the hidden lair of the unseen thief.

The lair is a large, circular chamber with a high ceiling. The walls are lined with shelves filled with stolen magical artifacts and strange, arcane devices. In the center of the chamber stands a raised dais, upon which rests a pedestal holding the stolen artifact - a glowing, crystalline orb.

The thief, a mysterious figure clad in dark robes and a featureless mask, stands before the pedestal. They are flanked by two **Shadow Demons** (MM p277), summoned to protect the lair.

The thief speaks in a cold, emotionless voice: "You have found me, but you are too late. The artifact is mine, and I will not relinquish it willingly. Prepare to face the consequences of your meddling."

## The Thief's Identity
As the battle begins, the thief's true identity is revealed. They are **Vex'aria**, a former member of the Arcane Council who was expelled for her unorthodox and dangerous experiments. Vex'aria has been stealing magical artifacts to power her latest creation - a device that will allow her to tap into the raw, primal magic of the planes and gain god-like powers.

Vex'aria is a formidable opponent, wielding powerful spells and arcane magic. She is also a master of illusions and can create convincing duplicates of herself to confuse and misdirect her enemies.

If the party manages to defeat Vex'aria and her shadow demons, they can claim the stolen artifact and return it to the Arcane Council. The council member who first approached the party will reward them handsomely for their efforts.

However, if Vex'aria is allowed to complete her device, she will become a powerful and dangerous new force in the world, threatening the balance of magic and potentially plunging the realm into chaos.

## Roleplaying Vex'aria
Vex'aria is a brilliant but unhinged arcane scholar, driven by an insatiable hunger for knowledge and power. She believes that the ends justify the means and has no qualms about stealing, manipulating, or even killing those who stand in her way.

Despite her ruthless nature, Vex'aria is not entirely evil. She genuinely believes that her actions will ultimately benefit the world, even if the path to that goal is paved with suffering and destruction. She is also fiercely intelligent and can hold her own in a battle of wits, using her knowledge of arcane lore to outmaneuver and outsmart her foes.

Vex'aria is a tall, slender woman with pale skin, dark hair, and piercing green eyes. She wears a long, flowing robe adorned with intricate arcane sigils, and her face is obscured by a featureless, expressionless mask.

## The Stolen Artifact
The stolen artifact is a **Sphere of Annihilation** (DMG p201), a deadly and dangerous magical item. It is a small, perfectly spherical object, no larger than a marble, that appears to be made of polished black stone. When activated, it creates a sphere of antimagic that grows to encompass a 60-foot radius, negating magic within that area and dealing 10d6 force damage to any creature caught inside.

The sphere is incredibly rare and valuable, and its theft has caused great concern among the members of the Arcane Council. They are desperate to have it returned, and will reward the party handsomely for its safe recovery.

## Consequences
If the party successfully recovers the sphere and returns it to the Arcane Council, they will be hailed as heroes and rewarded with a significant amount of gold, magical items, and the council's eternal gratitude. They may also be offered positions as official agents of the council, tasked with protecting the city from future threats.

If Vex'aria is allowed to complete her device and gain her newfound powers, she will become a major threat to the city and the surrounding region. The party may be called upon to stop her once again, this time with even higher stakes and greater dangers.

## Alternate Endings
If the party decides to side with Vex'aria and help her complete her device, they will gain a powerful ally but also become embroiled in a web of intrigue and danger. Vex'aria may reward them with magical items or knowledge, but she will also expect them to carry out her bidding and further her goals.

If the party fails to defeat Vex'aria and her shadow demons, they may be captured and imprisoned in the lair. They will have to find a way to escape and regroup before attempting to confront Vex'aria again.

## The Unseen Thief
A stealthy party may be able to sneak into the lair and steal the sphere without confronting Vex'aria directly. However, this will require a series of successful Dexterity (Stealth) checks and may alert Vex'aria to the party's presence, leading to a chase through the sewer tunnels.

If the party manages to steal the sphere and escape, Vex'aria will be furious and will stop at nothing to reclaim her prize. She may send her shadow demons or other minions to hunt down the party and retrieve the sphere by force.

## The Sewer Tunnels
The sewer tunnels are a maze-like network of interconnected passages, filled with hazards and dangers. The party may encounter various creatures and obstacles as they navigate the tunnels, including:

1. **Sewer Rats (MM p348)**: Swarms of sewer rats infest the tunnels, scavenging for food. They attack any creatures they perceive as a threat.

2. **Giant Centipedes (MM p334)**: These massive insects lurk in the shadows, waiting to ambush unsuspecting prey.

3. **Giant Leeches (MM p335)**: These grotesque creatures attach themselves to the party members, draining their blood and dealing damage over time.
